Overview:

This project represents my attempt at using python's flask package to create a "blog" web application.
This project also demonstrates the use of other supporting flask packages and database packages such as 
flask_login and SQLAlchemy. 

Features:

Users can create accounts, make posts, and add comments and "likes" to posts.
